# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

Hello I am Oscar Galindo and this is my project for the full stack internship at Cloudfare.

I have implemented all the points of the extra credit as well as those expected in the regular credit. The link to access the worker instance that I released for this project is: https://take-home-intern-project.oscargalindom.workers.dev. I decided to leave my account number under the wrangler.toml file just as another means to verify it is myaccount/project/etc.

Hope to talk to you soon,

-Oscar Galindo
